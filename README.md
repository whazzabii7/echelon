# echelon

*quick disclaimer: english is not my native language and since this is only for learning purposes, I will not pay attention to correct english!*

echelon is a little learning project of mine, it simulates an orbital environment and different types of satelites orbiting an ancient sci fi planet. Those satelites are part of the "echelon"-system, obviously named after the spynetwork founded in WWII.

I will keep this project as public, so if someone stumbles upon this, can follow my progress on this one. 

About technical stuff, the satelites shoud have a 8-bit CPU and various other simulated hardware like sensores etc. also I will simulate the orbit like GPS, sun light meteor storms and more, every single satelite will run in a single "thread" and to some you later will be possible to login to a virtuell shell. 

I will add the "specs" of the satilite types as markdown files in the project. Also I use Obsidian to manage some writen stuff for the project

As language I choose freeBasic, to give the project a kind of retro vibe since I was inspired by Cowboy Beebop, a little bit of C and/or Assembly to glue everything together and it is planned to use lua(jit) as interface to "communicate" with the satelites.
